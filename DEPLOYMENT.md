## üîß Required: Database Migration

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST run the database migration to add the new columns to your production database.

### Step 1: Access Railway PostgreSQL

```bash
# Option A: Use Railway CLI
railway run psql

# Option B: Get connection string from Railway dashboard
# Then connect using any PostgreSQL client
```

### Step 2: Run Migration Script

Copy and paste the contents of `scripts/add-discount-tip-columns.sql` into your PostgreSQL client:

```sql
-- This will:
-- 1. Add discount column if not exists
-- 2. Add tip column if not exists
-- 3. Set default values for existing records
```

### Step 3: (Optional) Clean Up Duplicates

If you want to remove the duplicate orders from October 27:

1. First, REVIEW the duplicates:
   ```sql
   -- Run the SELECT statements from scripts/cleanup-duplicate-orders.sql
   -- This will show you which orders are duplicates
   ```

2. After verifying, uncomment and run the DELETE statement in `scripts/cleanup-duplicate-orders.sql`

## üß™ Testing the Fixes

### Test 1: Discount Application
1. Go to Sales screen
2. Select customer "Mitzy" (with 30% discount)
3. Add items totaling $65
4. Verify checkout shows $45 (after discount)
5. Complete the sale
6. Check History - should show $45 with discount breakdown

### Test 2: Payment Method
1. Select a customer
2. Choose "Cr√©dito" as payment method
3. Complete the sale
4. Check History - should show "Cr√©dito" not "Efectivo"
5. Check Customer Credits section - should show the charge

### Test 3: No More Duplicates
1. Make a sale
2. Click "Pagar" button multiple times rapidly
3. Check History - should only show ONE order
4. Backend logs should show "‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicate order attempt detected"

### Test 4: Correct Daily Totals
1. Go to Reports or Dashboard
2. Check totals for any date
3. Duplicates are now automatically excluded from calculations
4. Numbers should match manual calculations

## üìä What Changed

### Frontend
- **SalesScreen**: No longer converts Cr√©dito to Efectivo; prevents duplicate submissions
- **AppContext**: Calculates discount properly; clears cart before async ops
- **HistoryScreen**: Shows discount breakdown (subtotal, discount, tip, total)
- **All Report Screens**: Apply deduplication before calculations

### Backend
- **server.js**: Stores discount and tip; implements idempotency validation
- **Database**: New columns `discount` and `tip` in orders table

### New Files
- `utils/deduplication.ts`: Utility functions to remove duplicate orders
- `scripts/add-discount-tip-columns.sql`: Database migration
- `scripts/cleanup-duplicate-orders.sql`: Remove existing duplicates

---

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Run the migration ASAP** - The app expects the new columns to exist
2. **Existing orders** will have `discount = 0` and `tip = 0` by default
3. **New orders** will properly store discount and tip values
4. **Duplicates** are now prevented at multiple levels (frontend + backend)
5. **Daily totals** automatically exclude duplicates from calculations

---

## üêõ If You See Issues

### "Column 'discount' does not exist"
- You need to run the database migration: `scripts/add-discount-tip-columns.sql`

### Duplicates still appearing
- Clear your browser cache and reload
- Verify the deployment completed successfully
- Check Railway logs for idempotency warnings

### Discount not showing in history
- Only NEW orders will show discount breakdown
- Existing orders don't have discount data stored
