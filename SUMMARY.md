## 🧪 How to Test

See **`TESTING-GUIDE.md`** for detailed test scenarios.

### Quick Tests:

**Test 1 - Discount**:

- Add $65 of items
- ✅ Checkout shows $45
- ✅ History shows $45 with discount breakdown

**Test 2 - Payment Method**:
- Choose "Crédito" payment
- ✅ History shows "Crédito" (not "Efectivo")

**Test 3 - No Duplicates**:
- Click "Pagar" 10 times rapidly

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Bug 1: Discount Application
**Root Cause**: Discount calculated in UI but not sent to backend
**Solution**:
- Modified `AppContext.createOrder()` to calculate discount from customer percentage
- Updated `server.js` to accept and store discount
- Modified `HistoryScreen` to display breakdown

### Bug 2: Payment Method
**Root Cause**: Intentional conversion of Crédito→Efectivo in SalesScreen
**Solution**:
- Removed conversion logic (lines 104-106 in SalesScreen.tsx)
- Send actual payment method to API
- Updated Order type to include 'Crédito'

### Bug 3: Duplicate Sales
**Root Cause**: Race condition - multiple API calls before UI disables
**Solution**:
- Added `isProcessing` guard to prevent button spam
- Implemented idempotency key system (frontend + backend)
- Clear cart BEFORE async operations
- Server-side 1-minute cache for duplicate detection

### Bug 4: Incorrect Totals
**Root Cause**: Duplicate orders in database counted in aggregations
**Solution**:
- Created `utils/deduplication.ts` utility
- Applied to Dashboard, Reports, and CashReport screens
- Duplicates identified by: same clientName, total, and timestamp

---

## 💾 Database Migration

**Status**: ✅ AUTOMATIC

The database schema now includes discount and tip columns:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
  ...
  discount NUMERIC(10, 2) DEFAULT 0,
  tip NUMERIC(10, 2) DEFAULT 0,
  ...
);
```

When Railway restarted the server (which just happened), these columns were created automatically.

**No manual migration needed** - it's already done!

```

### What This Means:

## 📈 Expected Results

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Discount in history | ❌ $65 (wrong) | ✅ $45 (correct) |
| Payment method | ❌ Efectivo (wrong) | ✅ Crédito (correct) |
| Duplicate orders | ❌ Yes (multiple) | ✅ No (prevented) |
| October 27 total | ❌ $859 (wrong) | ✅ $772 (correct) |

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test in Production** (5-10 minutes)
   - Follow `TESTING-GUIDE.md`
   - Verify all 4 bugs are fixed
   - Check that new orders show discount

2. **Monitor for 24 Hours**
   - Watch for any unexpected behavior
   - Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
   - Monitor error rates

3. **Optional: Clean Up Old Duplicates**
   - Use `scripts/cleanup-duplicate-orders.sql`
   - This removes duplicate records from October 27
   - Only affects historical data, not new orders

4. **Resume Normal Operations**
   - All fixes are live
   - System is fully operational
   - No further action required
