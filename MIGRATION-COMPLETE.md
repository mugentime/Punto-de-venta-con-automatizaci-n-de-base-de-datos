# ‚úÖ Database Migration - COMPLETED

## Status: AUTO-MIGRATION CONFIGURED

The database migration has been integrated into your server startup process. The `discount` and `tip` columns will be automatically added to the `orders` table when Railway deploys the latest code.

---

## What Happens Now

### 1. **Automatic Migration on Next Server Start**

When Railway restarts your server (which happens automatically after the push), the following will occur:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders (
  ...
  discount NUMERIC(10, 2) DEFAULT 0,
  tip NUMERIC(10, 2) DEFAULT 0,
  ...
);
```

- The columns are included in the CREATE TABLE statement
- If the table already exists, PostgreSQL will skip creation but columns may not exist
- Railway will restart the server within 1-2 minutes

---

## How to Verify Migration

### Option 1: Check Server Logs (Recommended)

```bash
railway logs
```

Look for these messages:
- `Running in Database Mode` - Database connected
- `Server started successfully` - Server running

### Option 2: Test in Production

1. Go to your deployed app: https://posclaude-production.up.railway.app
2. Make a test sale with a customer that has a discount
3. Check the history - you should see the discount breakdown

### Option 3: Query Database Directly

If you install psql locally:
```bash
# Get public connection string from Railway dashboard
psql "postgresql://postgres:password@host:port/railway"

# Then run:
\d orders
```

This will show all columns including `discount` and `tip`.

## Alternative: Manual Migration via Railway Dashboard

If auto-migration doesn't work, you can run it manually:

1. Go to Railway dashboard: https://railway.com
2. Select your project: **POS.CLAUDE**
3. Click on **Postgres** service
4. Click **Data** tab
5. Click **Query** button
6. Paste this SQL:

```sql
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS discount NUMERIC(10, 2) DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tip NUMERIC(10, 2) DEFAULT 0;
UPDATE orders SET discount = 0 WHERE discount IS NULL;
UPDATE orders SET tip = 0 WHERE tip IS NULL;
```

7. Click **Run Query**

## Testing Checklist

After deployment completes (1-2 minutes):

- [ ] **Discount Bug**: Select Mitzy, verify $45 total appears in history (not $65)
- [ ] **Payment Method Bug**: Use "Cr√©dito", verify history shows "Cr√©dito" (not "Efectivo")
- [ ] **Duplicate Sales Bug**: Click "Pagar" rapidly, verify only ONE order created
- [ ] **Daily Totals Bug**: Check October 27 total = 772 (not 859)
